So when we look at the plots, we notice a clear pattern: the calibrated model and the actual market prices don’t quite match, especially for very low strike prices— around strikes of 0.10 to 0.15, the model prices (the blue crosses) and the market prices (the orange circles) start to pull apart. The model just isn’t tracking the real prices well in that zone.
The reason is During calibration, we used Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the objective function.The problem is, for very small option prices — like deep out-of-the-money puts — even if the model prediction is quite a bit off, the absolute error stays small.Because MSE looks at absolute errors, the optimizer doesn't really "care" much about those small prices.Instead, it focuses more on fitting the larger prices — like options that are closer to at-the-money — because mistakes there cause a bigger impact on the loss.
So in the end, the model fits the middle strikes pretty well but doesn't do a good job in the very low strike range — around 0.10 to 0.15 — which is exactly where we see the biggest bias.
